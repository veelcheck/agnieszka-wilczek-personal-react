While it doesn't heavily rely on JavaScript, it does showcase a good deal of CSS. Take a moment to compare it with the site you're currently exploring, built with React and Tailwind.

Through a simple click on the like or dislike button, you can create a list of movies you want to catch and those you'd rather skip. Initially started as a CodeCademy project with foundational code, but I took it up a notch, making the site responsive and fully functional. The technologies employed include JavaScript and CSS, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.",
