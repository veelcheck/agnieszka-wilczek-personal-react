# React + Vite

## Project Overview

This site serves as a showcase of my understanding of various technologies and concepts, including:

- **React:** The project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It demonstrates my proficiency in creating modular and reusable components.

- **React Router:** The site utilizes React Router to implement navigation and showcase my knowledge of routing in single-page applications.

- **Hooks:** Leveraging React hooks, such as useState and useEffect, the project demonstrates my grasp of functional components and state management.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Explore the styles in the codebase to see how Tailwind classes are employed for efficient and responsive styling.

Feel free to explore the codebase to see how these technologies are implemented and how they contribute to the functionality and structure of the site.
